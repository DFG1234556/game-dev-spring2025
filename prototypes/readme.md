## Breakout-V1
![V1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LLfeag03Aa-3PCm7QzlAlQVP5Z5DkdGR/view?usp=share_link)
The first version of the prototype focuses on establishing the fundamental mechanics of a breakout-style game while introducing an element of discovery. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks, with the goal of clearing all breakable bricks to enter the next level. Some bricks contain special effects (ball acceleration bricks and unbreakable bricks), but these effects remain hidden until struck by the ball, and the effects are only triggered at the second collision.
To make the game more challenging, the ball moves faster than the paddle, forcing players to plan paddle movement, particularly before aiming at the acceleration bricks. In this version, the placement of these special bricks is fixed, allowing players to gradually uncover their locations as they play, encouraging exploration, learning, and rewarding multiple attempts. A scoring system is also introduced to track the number of bricks destroyed, providing another way to measure success beyond just clearing levels. This system gives players additional motivation to refine their approach and aim for higher scores.
Playtesting showed that this mechanic successfully challenged players while also making their progress feel rewarding. Players adjusted their strategies over time as they learned the brick layout and optimized their playstyle. One playtester made multiple attempts, nearly making it through several special bricks. She described the game as the “Dark Souls of Breakout” but expressed her enjoyment throughout the playtest. Each time she achieved a new high score, she cheered enthusiastically, demonstrating her engagement and excitement despite the difficulty. However, two other playtesters felt the game was too difficult, though they enjoyed the “surprises” of discovering special bricks. This contrast in player responses presented a design choice—maintain the high difficulty to reward mastery or introduce adjustments to make the game more approachable.

## Breakout-V2

Based on V1 feedback, this prototype prioritizes the sense of discovery by making special bricks less predictable rather than directly altering the game’s overall difficulty, which was previously controlled by the ball/paddle speed. The goal is to maintain a balance between strategic gameplay and the thrill of unexpected effects, allowing players to continuously experience something new while refining their approach. V1 playtesting revealed that the fixed placement of special bricks made repeated playthroughs too predictable, reducing the excitement of discovery. To address the issue, special bricks are now assigned randomly at the start of each gameplay, ensuring a fresh gameplay experience with each attempt. The number of special bricks also increases as levels progress, gradually elevating the challenge while keeping the element of surprise intact.
Adjustments are made to gameplay controls based on V1 playtesting. Some players struggled with the acceleration brick, as the sudden speed increase made the game difficult to manage. To provide better control, the default ball speed and paddle speed have been tuned to give players more time to react and plan their moves. Additionally, a modification is made to prevent the ball from entering near-horizontal movement when making shallow contact with the paddle, ensuring the game remains dynamic and preventing slow, repetitive motions. In addition, V2 also reorganizes the game layout so that bricks are no longer directly connected, ensuring that only one brick is destroyed per impact. This change improves gameplay clarity, allowing players to better anticipate how each hit will affect the brick layout.
Another critical change in V2 is the shift in the win condition. Instead of requiring players to clear all breakable bricks, the goal is now to break through the walls and reach the finish zone. This change encourages strategic decision-making, as players must determine the most efficient path to victory rather than focusing on total destruction. Casual players can now avoid acceleration bricks if they plan their paddle movement carefully. Competitive players can still choose to challenge themselves as the number of bricks destroyed is recorded and scored as points, allowing players to track improvement over time while giving others the flexibility to approach levels differently.
However, since the winning condition was not clearly defined in this prototype, playtesters did not immediately realize that reaching the finish zone was the new objective. Players continued to focus on breaking all bricks, as that had been the goal in the previous version. This confusion highlighted the importance of communicating changes in rules, especially for returning playtesters who already had an impression of how the game worked. Without proper labeling or visual cues, players carried over their previous assumptions, which led to frustration when they realized the goal had shifted after multiple attempts. To address this, future prototypes should introduce clear indicators to ensure that any fundamental changes in mechanics are easily recognizable, allowing players to engage with the intended strategy from the start.

## Breakout-V3

This prototype focuses on refining the randomization system for special bricks while addressing feedback from V2 playtesting. The previous version introduced random placement for special bricks to prevent predictable playthroughs, but this led to inconsistent difficulty levels. In some cases, special bricks clustered together, making certain areas of the level significantly harder while leaving others relatively empty. To improve playability, V3 introduces controlled randomization, ensuring that special bricks are evenly distributed across rows while still maintaining randomness. For example, if a level contains three acceleration bricks and three block bricks spread across five rows, at least one special brick appears in each row, with the remaining ones placed randomly. This adjustment maintains the sense of discovery while ensuring a fair challenge throughout the level.
In response to V2 feedback, V3 aims to provide strategic clarification so that players can focus more on strategy and execution rather than trying to decipher the mechanics through trial and error. This prototype clarifies the winning condition with a highlighted finish zone. A frequent Candy Crush player particularly appreciated this update, stating that she preferred a target-based clearing objective over full completion, which often felt time-consuming. In addition, V3 also introduces special brick indicators, which display the number of each type of special brick in the level. As these bricks are destroyed, the corresponding icons decrease in number, giving players a visual reference for what to expect next.
Another key adjustment in this version is the reintroduction of multi-brick destruction. In V2, brick layouts were adjusted so that only one brick could be destroyed per impact to ensure predictability. However, playtesters felt that this restriction limited their ability to play creatively and made the game more time-consuming. V3 restores the ability to destroy two connecting bricks at once, giving players more flexibility in their strategy. This change made the game feel more rewarding while still maintaining clarity in how brick destruction worked.
Playtesters also expressed interest in having more special bricks with unique effects. In response, an attempt was made to introduce a power-up that temporarily increased the paddle size for three seconds. However, this attempt was not achieved as the enlarged collider’s position did not align correctly with the enlarged visual representation, causing inconsistent collision detection. Since this directly impacted gameplay and fairness, the power-up was removed for this version. The process highlighted the importance of fully refining new mechanics before introducing them, and further adjustments will be needed before reintroducing this feature in a future update.

## Breakout-V4

While V3 effectively refined the randomization of special bricks and made the game’s objectives clearer, V4 focuses on improving strategic gameplay and promoting replays. This prototype introduces a new automatic replay system, making gameplay more engaging regardless of whether the player wins or loses. When a level ends, the game initiates an instant replay of the final moments in a smaller pop-up window, where points and the replay button are also displayed. Emulating a sports-style replay that observes key moments, this system aims to keep momentum high, encouraging player reflection, strategy enhancement, and retries.
To further support replayability, hidden special bricks are now revealed during a replay, giving players insight into what was missed in their previous attempt. While these bricks will be randomized in the next playthrough, seeing them in the replay provides a sense of how close they were to achieving a full combo or winning the level. This allows players to better assess their strategy while maintaining the excitement of discovery in future attempts.
Additionally, V4 also refines brick destruction mechanics and visual clarity. To facilitate targeting for multi-brick destruction, each brick now has an outer frame, making shared borders more visible and easier to aim for. Additionally, the ball size has been slightly increased, increasing the likelihood of destroying two bricks at once, further enhancing strategy and control over destruction paths.
With these updates, V4 playtests aim to assess how effectively the new replay system encourages players to engage with multiple playthroughs and refine their strategies. By implementing an automatic replay feature, the goal is to see whether players feel motivated to analyze their performance and make adjustments in subsequent attempts. The hope is that revealing missed special bricks during replays will create a stronger sense of progression, giving players a reason to return and experiment with different approaches.

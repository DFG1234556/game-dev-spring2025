# I Wanna Be The Guy

Movements in I Wanna Be the Guy is extremely responsive but also extremely difficult to control due to its high control sensitivity. Since movement speed is fixed, the character accelerates instantly to full speed when a movement key is pressed. The running speed remains constant at all time and the character stops upon releasing a movement input almost immediately (not 100% sure since it seems to have a very slight skid), allowing for quick adjustments near hazards since there is no gradual acceleration or deceleration beyond that skid effect. However, as there is no buffer to compensate for overcorrection, precise control is required to complete each level, especially in sections with limited space or small landing areas.

Jumping in I Wanna Be The Guy offers a high degree of mid-air control, allowing players to adjust direction both during ascent and descent. The jump height varies by how long the jump button is pressed and the character can double at any point in the air, allowing players to change direction in the middle of a jump and making it possible to reposition in the air. Even after a double jump, directional input can still affect character’s falling behavior, allowing players to push the character forward/backward slightly before landing.

The level design in this game is heavily influenced by its movement mechanics. Mastery of both precise ground control and mid-air adjustments are required to enter the next level. Since there is no saving point, players have to be truly familiar with the traps and the controls to progress through each section without error. Though the levels do seem to get harder by introducing more hazard mechanics, the beginning level is already hard enough with little room for hesitation or imprecise execution. However, as players repeated start over, they gradually adapt to the game's mechanics, refine input timing, and develop the precision needed to overcome obstacles more effectively.

## Starbound

Starbound does not follow the conventions of a typical platformer, as its design focuses more on exploration than precise movement control. Movement and jumping serve as tools for discovery rather than skill-based challenges. Movement in Starbound, in particular, feels floaty and somewhat off, which may be designed intentionally to present the space theme. The “inaccuracy” is largely caused by a low initial impulse when pressing a movement key. As the character accelerates, the movement feels sluggish when trying to reach full speed. Similarly, the character does not stop immediately after releasing a movement key, as the character slides slightly before coming to a full halt, making quick directional changes feel slow and unresponsive. As a result, movement control lacks precision, creating challenges when tight control is required, such as platforming over hazards.

The jump movement follows the same pattern, with a slow initial speed and limited control in mid-air. The base jump is often insufficient for certain tasks, and double jump/pulse jump is allowed for additional mobility. Some weapons can also trigger fast vertical movement, providing alternative ways to reach high terrains. However, these weapon-based abilities are not available at the start of the game and need to be acquired by collecting resources.

Starbound’s level design also addresses more on exploration, and does not really rely on the traditional platforming sequences. Planets (terrain) are procedurally generated with varied landscapes, forcing strategical changes each time. Unlike I Wanna Be The Guy, Starbound encourages players to find different ways of reaching new areas, such as modifying the terrain, and does not require players to complete a level entirely with precise movement execution or techniques.

## Spirit Farer

Similar to Starbound, Spirit Farer though has a platforming segment focuses on storytelling and resource management, so the platforming control is relatively easy. The character moves at a constant speed with no acceleration or deceleration unless when dash is pressed, and stops instantly when directional input is released, even during dashing. This simplicity of movement control ensures that players can focus on the story rather than mastering challenging platforming mechanics.

However, there are challenges in timing a jump, especially a double jump, to reach an area as other platformers do. The character can adjust direction mid-air, allowing players to fine-tune their landings after a jump. As the story progresses, the character gains the ability to glide, allowing controlled slow fall downs to navigate through complex vertical spaces.

Other movements, such as bounce, a higher jump on bouncy platforms, are unlocked when conditions are met. As the platforming segment gradually becomes more difficult, these extra movements are needed to access specific areas. In addition, Spirit Farer has a sand box essence which allows the player to build the ship, where a routine platforming quest occurs, meaning that the platforming challenges are essentially designed by players themselves. As the story progresses, more buildings are added to the ship, and players have to structure an efficient pathway for the platforming needs.

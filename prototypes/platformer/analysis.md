## Castlevania (1986)

In Castlevania, movement is quite rigid, as the character moves at a fixed speed without any acceleration or deceleration. The character stops instantly when the player releases the button, with no sliding, momentum, or allowance for last-minute corrections. The character cannot move while crouching either, further limiting his ability to adjust quickly in combat or platforming sections.

Jumping in Castlevania is equally restrictive. Once the character leaves the ground, the player cannot change direction mid-air. The jump height is also fixed, regardless of how long the jump button is held. This makes platforming and combat extremely methodical, as enemies and gaps must be approached with caution. The inability to correct a jump mid-air means that mistimed jumps are punishing, often leading to unavoidable damage or death.

Because of these movement and jump mechanics, the game’s level design is constructed to challenge the player’s precision rather than reflexes, and enemies are strategically placed in ways that exploit the lack of aerial mobility, forcing the player to plan their leaps with enemy movement in mind. The mechanics of stairs also add to the deliberate nature of movement, as the character cannot jump on or off them, making it a separate, slower-paced mechanic.


## Donkey Kong (1981)

Movement in Donkey Kong is simple but also somewhat stiff. The character begins walking slowly and builds up a bit of speed, but this acceleration is minimal. The player can reverse direction instantly, but there is a slight input delay that makes movement feel "sticky". The overall movement control is quite restricted.

Jumping in Donkey Kong is entirely committed. The moment the character leaves the ground, the trajectory is locked, allowing no mid-air adjustments. Jump height is also fixed, meaning that the player cannot control how high he jumps based on button press duration. Climbing ladders is another key area of movement, as the character cannot jump off ladders, making positioning more critical.

Since movement is slower and jumps cannot be adjusted, every challenge in the game is about precise timing rather than fluid platforming. Each stage is a puzzle that forces the player to adapt to and develop strategies based on the rigid movement system while planning routes. The presence of ladders as primary paths instead of platforming sequences forces strategical navigation. Gaps are small and therefore more manageable, but their placement in relation to hazards like barrels and fire traps makes timing jumps the core challenge of the game.


## Prince of Persia (1989)

Compared to Donkey King, Prince of Persia has a more realistic, physics-based movement system. The character does not move instantly but accelerates into a run, requiring players to anticipate momentum when navigating. Similarly, stopping does not happen instantly. When the player releases the movement key, the character skids slightly before coming to a complete halt. Due to the acceleration, switching between walking and running is not immediate but is a key to avoid hazards. 

Jumping in Prince of Persia is also momentum-based, as a running jump covers more ground than a standing jump. Unlike Castlevania, where jumps are locked but predictable, Prince of Persia gives players more contro. While slight mid-air adjustments are possible, jumps still require careful planning. Additionally, the game features an edge-grabbing mechanic, allowing players to survive jumps that would otherwise be fatal by catching ledges just before falling, allowing players to miscalculate slightly and still recover.

Because of this movement system, the level design in Prince of Persia focuses heavily on precision-based platforming and trap avoidance, requiring players to think ahead before moving. Traps such as spikes, collapsing floors, or pressure plates are placed in a way that punishes reckless running or blind jumps. Enemy encounters are also designed around the movement, with sword fights emphasizing positioning rather than rapid button presses. The emphasis on timing makes each level feel more like a puzzle, where every step and jump must be measured carefully.
